How many total reviews (rows in Reviews) connect these users to businesses?
Is there a small set of “power reviewer” users that write the majority of reviews? Are there a few businesses with disproportionately high review counts?

Check how many unique users reviewed each business (do some businesses have a very diverse user base while others get repeated reviews from the same users?).
